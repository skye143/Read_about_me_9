# Your assignment Title

## Description 

As a developer, your GitHub profile is a crucial component of your public identity, and a well-crafted profile can effectively exhibit your work to other developers and prospective employers. Amongst the key elements of your GitHub profile, the README.md file is often neglected by novice developers, but is a crucial feature that should not be overlooked.

The quality of a README often differentiates a good assignment from a bad assignment. An excellent README provides a chance to clarify and demonstrate the application's purpose, justify the technologies employed, and highlight some of the challenges encountered and potential features to be implemented in the future. By creating an outstanding README, you can differentiate yourself from the vast number of developers publishing their work on GitHub.

There is no one definitive way to design a great README, but it is categorically wrong to exclude one or to create a meagre one. This guide presents some best practices to follow, and as you progress in your career, you will develop your own opinions on what constitutes a good README.

At a minimum, your assignment README must comprise a title and a brief explanation of the what, why, and how. What motivated you to develop this assignment? Why did you create it? (Hint: answering "because it was a homework assignment" is not sufficient.) What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What distinguishes your assignment?

Finally, if your assignment is deployed, it is essential to provide a link to the deployed application.

For individuals who are unfamiliar with Markdown, read the GitHub guide on [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

If you require an example of a well-crafted README, kindly refer to the following link: [the VSCode repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode).


## Table of Contents (Optional)

To improve the user experience and facilitate navigation, consider adding a table of contents to your README if it's lengthy. This will help users quickly locate the information they require while reading your README.md.

* [Installation](#installation)
* [Usage](#usage)
* [Credits](#credits)
* [License](#license)


## Installation

What are the steps required to install your assignment? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.


## Usage  
Please furnish guidelines and examples for utilization, incorporating visual representations as deemed necessary.

For further guidance on how to incorporate screenshots into your examples, please refer to the following website:

####--------------------------------------


## Credits

Please provide a comprehensive list of any individuals or entities with whom you collaborated, along with their corresponding GitHub profiles, if applicable.

Additionally, if any third-party assets were utilized in the creation of this project that require attribution, please identify the original creators and provide links to their primary web presence.

If tutorials were followed during the development process, kindly include relevant links to those resources as well.


## License

The last section of a good README is a license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your assignment. If you need help choosing a license, use [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/)

üèÜ The sections listed above are the minimum requirements for a good README, but your assignment will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

The acquisition of badges is not inherently requisite, nonetheless, they serve as a manifestation of one's credibility. Badges function as a means of communicating to fellow developers that an individual possesses a proficient skillset. I would recommend examining the badges accessible through [shields.io](https://shields.io/). Although the current significance of certain badges may be ambiguous, over time their meanings will become comprehensible.


## Features

If your assignment has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them there.


## Contributing

If you have developed an application or package and intend to solicit contributions from other developers, it is recommended to provide guidelines for the contribution process. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is widely recognized as an industry standard, although you have the option of drafting your own guidelines.

## Tests

It is highly recommended to extend the effort beyond the basic requirements by composing test cases for your application. Subsequently, furnish illustrative instances that explicate the procedure to execute said tests.
